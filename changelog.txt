	Implemented BIP0038 as an option for printing encrypted paper wallets
	Brought in zimage's bitcoin-python-library
	Added dialog boxes for error messages which were previously only showing up in the terminal and were therefore useless to the end user


From 1.02 to 1.03:

From 1.04 to 1.05:
	Removed the ability to use BIP0038 with litecoin because the bitcoin python library we are using has no litecoin fork yet

From 1.05 to 1.06:
